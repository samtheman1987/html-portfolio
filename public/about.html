<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samuel and I'm 35 years old. I've just started my journey to become a web developer with the help of
  Angela yu's "2023 Complete Web Developer Bootcamp". I'm looking forward to learn the basics in how to create webpages.
</p>

<p>In this webpage, which is my portfolio, you can find my very first projects that I have made through
   Angela yu's "2023 Complete Web Developer Bootcamp". These first projects are very simple and also the
  portfolio website, since it is written in only html. But as I learn more I will update the webpage with more projects and in time it
will not only be html as it is now, but all a webpage can be. </p>
